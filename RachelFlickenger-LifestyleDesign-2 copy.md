##### TRACKS → TRACKS STATEMENT AND ”THE ONE-WORD”

**_The Tracks I want to leave_** ... Rachel’s Legacy

Who is holding your hand? Daughter Riley

What Riley will say about me 15-years after I am gone:

- She was incredibly **loving, caring and smart**
- She would **do anything** for anyone
- **Selfless and giving**
- **Taught** me much about life
- How **to live happy**
- She was **authentic and real**
- To see **different perspectives** on how to **show up**
    **for myself and others**
- She had a keen sense of **understanding** and always
    knew things about people without really knowing
    them.
- She **guided** me towards success and never steered
    me in any direction other than the right one.

```
Tracks Statement by Riley : My mother was the greatest role model in
my life. She was always there to support me and never judged me and I
trust her. She comes from a place of love and experience and not just saying
things for the sake of saying things. This trust boosted my confidence knowing
I had my mom as my role model. She inspired me to go after my dreams.
Riley’s Response:
Role model - I admire your dedication, drive to be the best mom, boss and
woman you can be and I want to be just like you.
Guidance – you’ve picked me up when i’ve been down and gave me the
advice i need to fix my problems and set me in the right direction
Loyal / Supportive - you don’t tell me what i want to hear, you tell me
what i need to hear and always have my best interests at heart and you’ve
always put the boys and i above anyone and done everything and anything
for us.
My Tracks Are Based On This One Word : “Rock”
```
```
Rachel’s definition of ”Rock”: Someone who you can depend on no
matter what. They’re there for you , they support you, they “got you”, no
questions or judgement. Full trust and confidence. Your strength when
you’re weak. Unapologetic authentic and real.
```

###### PURPOSE STATEMENT → WHY I DO... → “I HELP X, DO Y SO THAT Z”

- Where does that come from in my life?
- **_Dad involved in my activities (i.e Sports) mom not so much_**
- **_Do something? Do it to the best of your ability._**
- **_Navigate life and learned how to figure it out on my own._**
    - **_Perspective - Open to possibilities and opportunities_**
- **_Intuitive - “as a little girl, I always knew I was gifted”_**
- **_Really connected with the universe – energy Flow._**
- Why do I do what I do? – I want people to understand that they are capable of anything they dream. Tear down the obstacles in their life –
    more out there for you. Create ways and different perspectives, opportunities options. Success is there for them to be found and experienced. I
    want them to win and be successful. I want to be successful too – I can’t be successful on my own. They win, I win.
- **_I get stuff done and I do it by bringing people together – take ownership and together as a team. Help to build trust, healthy conflict, and come_**
    **_to agreement and then execute the plan._**
- **_Project manager of people –_**
    - **_Let them do it because they’ll learn – Development_**
    - **_Catalyst and connector_**
- **_Know what kind of blocks are in place – Go from this to this?_**
- **_What if we look at it from this perspective or angle._**

I’ve learned how to share my gifts in a corporate environment and personally without revealing the origins of my skills.

```
My father - his perspective
```

###### PURPOSE STATEMENT → WHY I DO... → “I HELP X, DO Y SO THAT Z”

- **Who do I help? Primary -Corporate Leaders – Directors and above** , Secondarily Entrepreneurial Leaders
- **What do I help them do?** Navigate obstacles, Connect with others, **see different perspectives** that allow
    them to achieve greater heights,
- What does this do for them? Confidence to be more open and flexibile leader, understanding, tear down biases that
    may have existed in the past, get unstuck, **which ultimately gets them the results they’re after**.
- without X
- I help X, do Y, so they can Z: I help women in executive level roles to find solutions they are unable to find on their
    own to tap into their own intuition, so they can see opportunity they otherwise wouldn’t be able to see and
    discover their self-confidence.

Mandy is a cheerleader

       person standing in front of me – feelings (clear, murky, muddy, cemented). Ask “I wonder...” questions. Get
       rid of the bias and judgement, open up and feel it out... What if scenarios and more wondering questions

```
The biggest lesson I’ve learned if you want to
be taken seriously in your niche: establish
authority and credibility NOW!
```
```
If you want to spread yourself too thin and only 2x
your results, then focus on doing ALL of these things
at one time...
```
```
NOTE: This will wear you down and burn you out,
fast!
```
```
Instead, if you want to 10x your impact early on, you
must get specific and focus only on 1-2 areas of
influence, first. Only after you’ve 10x those 2 areas,
as you move into the next 1-2 areas, you’ll be able to
10x those results even faster.
```

##### THE FIRST ARE OF FOCUS FOR MY WORK: **IMPORTANT TO STICK

##### TO ONE UNTIL SUCCESS”

What is the vehicle to get them there: Coaching program, Continuity program, Community Ascension Model?

#### 1. Community Ascension Model – Free community, Free (value-based course), workshop, Group coaching, 1:1

#### coaching

2. Continuity Program: $97, $297, $997/m
3. High-ticket coaching program.


##### WHAT DO I WANT TO MEASURE?

Business continuity: Client Satisfaction – (Netpromoter)Client Engagement and Satisfaction:

- Number of clients enrolled in my coaching programs.
- Client satisfaction through surveys or testimonials.
- Retention rate (clients who continue with multiple sessions or renew contracts).

Lead Generation and Conversion Rates:

- Number of leads generated through marketing efforts (website traffic, social media,
    referrals, emails).
- Conversion rates from inquiries to paying clients.

Coaching Outcomes:

- Progress clients report toward their goals (e.g., improved confidence, clarity, or
    leadership effectiveness).
- Qualitative feedback on life or career transformations.

Revenue and Financial Performance:

- Total revenue and average revenue per client.
- Cost of client acquisition (marketing expenses divided by new clients acquired).
- Profit margins after operating expenses.

Personal Growth and Development:

- Time invested in professional development (e.g., attending workshops, certifications).

##### WHAT IS HOLDING ME BACK FROM SERVING MY CLIENTS?

Identifying Resistance will be key to ensuring you know your real enemy to success of your lifestyle biz.

Identifying the top 3 elements of resistance that may affect me serving my clients to the fullest of my capacity:

1. Imposter Syndrome
2. Saying no to others so that you can say yes to me...
3. Continue to serve my clients without feeling like they are taking over my time/life.

What would it mean for you to let resistance win and you not reaching the level of service you desire for your clients?
If resistance wins and I keep saying no to myself, the business will not be successful. I’ll be spending my time on things
not important to my clients success. I’ll be burnt out... CHASING VS ATTRACTING...

What would it mean for you to see the success of your clients?
** I’m living my purpose. I feel warm and connected to my purpose. I feel complete. **
