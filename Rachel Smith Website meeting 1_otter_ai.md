```
So	you	don't	mind	if	I	record?	No,	I	don't	mind.	I	have	no	worst	memory	ever.
```
## Rachel	Smith 00:

```
I	bought	some	things	too	because	I	didn't	know	what	you	wanted	to	like	see
```
## michael	parsons

```
or,	yeah,	I	actually,	I	don't	even	know,	I	don't	know	anything	about	it,	other	than	you	are
```
```
okay,	that's	literally	it	so
```
## Rachel	Smith 00:

```
well,	I	am	starting	my	a	new	business.	I'm	a	certified	life	coach,	and	I've	been	a	certified	life
coach	since	2018	However,	I've	worked	in	the	corporate	world	last	25	years	in	leadership,	so
I've	used	a	lot	of	the	coaching,	what	I've	learned	through	personal	development,	professional
development,	into	what	I	do	corporately.	And	to	be	very	simple,	the	majority	of	my	career	has
been	in	telemarketing.	So	I've	been,	you	know,	all	the	way	up	the	chain.	I've	been	a	director	of
Global	Operations	most	recently,	and	I	left	them	two	weeks	ago.	Oh,	okay,	so	I	decided	to	leave
and	start	my	own	business,	which	is	something	I've	been	thinking	about	for	a	very	long	time,
working	on	it	for	years,	but	not	so	much	along	the	lines	of	life	coaching,	as	more	intuitive
coaching,	intuitive	leadership	coaching,	so	more	along	the	lines	of,	I	do	want	to	work	with
```
```
R
```
```
R
```

```
executives,	C	suite	type	people,	but	I	mean,	if	there's	someone	that	comes	to	me	that	needs
coaching,	certainly	evaluate	and	see	if	they're	a	good	client.	But	I	have	all	of	this	kind	of	in	my	I
worked	with	a	coach	who	helped	me	develop	my	plan,	my	coaching	plan,	so	I	have	this	I	can
show	you	some	things	sure
```
## michael	parsons

```
it	doesn't
```
## Rachel	Smith 01:

```
matter	this	is	this	is	really	rough,	so	it	might	be	easier.	I	did	this	too.	I	did	a	couple	things	to
help	with	the	conversation.
```
## michael	parsons

```
Visual	aids	are	always	appreciated,	yeah,
```
## Rachel	Smith 02:

```
so	I	know	I'm	a	visual	person.	Like	everything	I	do	is	I'm	very	visual.	So	one	of	the	things	Greg
gave	me	was	a	list	of	questions	to	kind	of	help	navigate,	like,	what	the	website	would	be	about,
like,	the	different	pieces	of,	you	know	the	website,	and	I	know	he	used	chat	GPC,	so	I	use	chat
GPT	to	help	me	answer	them.	Good.	And	so	this	is,	this	is	all	of	these	questions.	So	it's	kind	of
like	it'll	give	you	an	idea	of	what	I'm	doing,	what	I	want	to	offer,	why	I	do	what	I	do.	And	then
the	only	thing	that's	not	correct	as	the	service	descriptions,	it	kind	of	gave	this.	I'm	still	working
through	this	suggestions.	I	have	most	of	that	in	here,	but	I	haven't	quite	worked	through	that.
But	I	don't	know	if	we	need	all	of	that	to	start.	I	think	it's	more	so,	you	know,	I	don't	know.	You
tell	me	you're	the	expert.	We'll	find	out.	But	anyway,	so,	yeah,	it's	an	intuitive	coaching
business.	I'm	starting	to	do	one	on	ones.	Eventually	like	to	do	mastermind	groups,	and	I	can
certainly	go	into	businesses.	I	can	do	some	consulting.	But	yeah,	that's	kind	of	where	I'm
starting.
```
## michael	parsons

```
I	got	you,	is	there	a	digital	version	of	both	of	these?	Yeah,
```
## Rachel	Smith 03:

```
I	think	I	can.	Yes,	I	can	send	you	both.	I	can	do	that.
```
## michael	parsons

R

R

R


```
And	you've	set	you	up	for	success.	This	is,	like,	way	more	than	most	people	do.	God,
```
## Rachel	Smith 03:

```
well,	I	think	it's	really	important.	I	mean,	to	be	honest,	this	guy	would	do	my	website	as	well.
But	who's	helping	with	this?	But,	you	know,	Greg	said	you're	already	here.	And	so	I	thought,
well,	I	don't	want	to	No	offense,	but	I	don't	want	to	pay	him,	like,
```
## michael	parsons

```
more	for	already	doing	it	absolutely	what	I	would	do	if	I	were	in	your	shoes.	Yeah,
```
## Rachel	Smith 03:

```
yeah.	So	he	knows	me	really	well,	so	then	he	knows	the	essence	of	what	I'm	doing,	and	just	this
is	just	between	you	and	I,	like,	this	is	really	a	personal	piece	of	work,	okay,	because	it's	really
going	into	what	my	fears	are	in	my	life,	but	I	want	to	see,	like	it	really,	this	is	like	a	life
coaching,	life	design	plan	where	he	dug	deep.	So	there's	going	to	be	things	in	here,	and	you're
like,	Oh,	this	is	very	personal	stuff,	but	it	gives	you	an	idea	of	the
```
## michael	parsons

```
essence	of	who	I	am.	And	if	it's	what	you	want	to	include	in	the	website,	that's	just,	and	I	don't
know	if	I	would	want
```
## Rachel	Smith 04:

```
to	include	all	this,	which	you	would	be	able	to	tell	when	you	read	it,	yeah,	but	it'll	give	you	an
idea	of	where,	where	I've	kind	of	come	from,	and	how	journeyed	along	till	I	got	to	this	point
today.
```
## michael	parsons

```
Real	quick.	Did	you	start	at	telemarketing?	And	now	you've,	you've,	you	moved	all	that	ladder,
is	what	you're	saying.	Like	telemarketing	was	at	the	beginning.	So
```
## Rachel	Smith 04:

```
I	went,	I	went	to	college,	and	I	got	a	degree	in	long	term	health	care	administration,	and	while	I
was	studying	for	my	state	boards,	I	needed	a	job,	part	time,	and	a	girlfriend	told	me	about,	hey,
why	don't	you	do	this	town	marketing	job?	And	I	was	like,	Oh,	this	is	gonna	suck.	And	it	did,	but
it	was,	it	was	quick,	easy	money,	and	it	was	flexible,	and	it	was	part	time.	I	thought	it	was	final
notice.	Well,	then,	you	know.	A	few	months	later,	I	ended	up	getting	a	supervisor	position	at
```
R

R

R

R


```
another	company	in	telemarketing,	and	I	had	a	team	of	agents.	We	called	them	something
different,	but	we	call	them	telemarketing	agents,	but,	and	then,	yeah,	I	did	that,	and	then	I	just
stayed	there,	and	I	just	kept	going,	see	that's
```
## michael	parsons

```
a	true	success	story.	I	don't	mean	to	interrupt	this.	I'm	always	happy	to	hear	whenever
someone	is	able	to	successfully	just	work	up	the	ladder,	rather	than,	like,	start
```
## Rachel	Smith 05:

```
giving	it	handed	to	them.	I	totally,	totally	appreciate	that.	And	I	assume	that's	because	where
you	are,	you	have	the	same	experience.	Yeah.
```
## michael	parsons

```
I	mean,	I	guess	I	identify	with	that	a	little	more	than	just	like,	it's	always	been	great,	you	know,
that's,	well,	you	know,	you
```
## Rachel	Smith 05:

```
learn	a	lot	more	about	people.	I	don't
```
## michael	parsons

```
think	you	grow	unless	you	struggle.	I	agree,	you	know,	and	I	think	I	didn't	need	to	get	off	on
this	table.	Yeah,	I	think	that's	all	I	really	want	to	say,	was	that	I'm	happy	and	impressed	that
that's	what	happened	for	you.	Yeah,
```
## Rachel	Smith 06:

```
yeah.	So,	I	mean,	I	I	stayed	in	telemarketing	for	a	while,	for	about	1015,	years,	and	I	took	about
a	five	year	break.	I	was	offered	a	position	at	another	company	as	vice	president	of	sales.	So	I
did	that	for	a	couple	years.	Then	I	left	there,	I	have	an	identical	twin	sister,	wow.	And	she	works
in	the	healthcare	field,	and	so	she	was	working	at	Mercy	Health	at	the	time,	where	I	took	this
vice	president	of	sales	positions	a	very	small	organization,	and	there	were	a	lot	of	aspects	of
the	job	I	just	didn't	care	for	very	night	and	day	compared	to	what	I	was	doing	in	telemarketing,
really	sounds	like	it.	So	she's	like,	Hey,	I	have	this	position	at	my	company	that's	open.	Come
apply.	So	I	did,	and	I	ended	up	working	for	her,	for	not	for	her,	but	with	her,	for	a	few	years,	at
Mercy	Health,	managing	physician	practices	and	the	Youngstown	residency,	like	site	and	at	the
hospital.	So	I	did	that	for	a	few	years,	and	then	COVID	hit,	and	I	was	like,	this	is	not	the	place	I
want	to	be.	Hospitals	became	the	worst.	So	in	2020	a	girlfriend	of	mine	reached	out	to	me	who
I	worked	with	prior	in	telemarketing	at	the	company.	I	say	we	grew	up	with	because	that's
where	I	was	the	majority	of	my	career,	for	15	years.	And	then	she	said	she	had	gotten	a	job	at
```
R

R

R


```
this	other	company,	working	from	home,	and	they	needed	somebody	in	operations,	would	you
want?	And	she	asked	me,	Do	you	want	to	come	back	to	telemarketing?	And	I	was	like,	yeah,	I
gotta	get	out	of	here,	because	COVID	is	not	fun.	And	I	knew	telemarketing,	so	I	did	that.	And
then	yeah,	so	I	was	there	for	about	five	years.	That	was	my	most	recent	role,	and	did	a	lot	of
different	things	there.	I	started	out	doing,	like,	operational	excellence	type	projects,	trying	to
create	process,	and	we'll	tear	processes	apart,	build	them	back	up,	and	train	and,	you	know,
create	consistency	across	sites	that	are	global.	So	we've	got	sites,	you	know,	in	different
countries,	and	making	sure	everybody's	kind	of	doing	the	same	thing	and	cultivating
relationships.	And	so	I	did	that	for	a	little	bit,	and	then	I	became	a	chief	of	staff	for	vice
president.	And	then	I	didn't	really	like	being	a	Chief	of	Staff.	Didn't	like	I	didn't	really	like	being
a	chief	staff	that	much,	but	the	company	was	morphing	a	lot,	so	I	said,	Put	me	back	into
operations.	I	want	to	be	a	director	of	operations	again.	So	so	that's	what	I	did,	until	I	left,	and
then	I	had,	yeah,	sites	in,	well,	in	Europe	and	Brazil	and	the	Philippines	and	in	Jamaica	and	in
the	US.	So	yeah.	So	I	got	to	work	with	teams	from	all	over,	which	was	really,	really	rewarding.
But	through	telemarketing,	I	realized	I	had	a	burnout	period,	which	is	when	I	did	that	five	little
break,	sure,	right?	And,	and	that's	when	all	of	this	really	started	clicking	for	me.	Was	like,	what
are	you	doing?	I	was,	I	was	working	at	a	startup	call	center,	and	was	killing	me.	It's	like,	
hours
```
## michael	parsons

```
a	week,	oh	my	goodness.	And	I
```
## Rachel	Smith 08:

```
was	just	dying	and	and	I	just	had	this	like	light	bulb	moment	where	I've	never	seen	a	psychic
before,	and	for	whatever	reason,	I	was	like,	You	need	to	go	see	a	psychic.	And	my	sister	had
just	seen	one,	and	so	she	had	to	give	me	that	number.	And	I	pulled	over	on	the	side	of	the	road
coming	home	from	work	one	day,	and	we	had	a	phone	call	and	made	an	appointment	to	go	see
this	psychic,	and	as	the	first	time	ever,	and	I	went,	and	she's	like,	things	are	going	to	be
happening	for	you,	but	just,	you	know,	like,	you	can	do	what	I	do.	And,	and	I	was	like,	Huh?	And
I	heard	some	of	that	a	little	bit	before.	Now,	I	don't	want	to	be	a	psychic,	doing	psychic
readings,	but	that's	kind	of	where	my	intuition	comes	from,	running.	I'm	an	empath.	So,	so	I
started	going	to	psychics	and	working	with	them,	and	then	everything	really	just	started	going
in	different	directions.	Different	directions	for	me.	And	that's	when	I	started	developing	my	skill
and	did	more	personal	development,	professional	development.	And,	yeah,	ended	up	meeting
Greg	and	and	he	introduced	me	to
```
## michael	parsons

```
people.	And	yeah,	Greg's	Cool.	Well,	clearly	you	think	Greg's	cool	dude,	it's	kind	of
```
```
cool.	So	anyway,	yeah.	So	I'm	sorry.	I	didn't	mean	to	interrupt	your	no
```
R


## Rachel	Smith 10:

```
no.	But	this	is,	this	is	you	didn't	interrupt	at	all.	That's	really	a	story.	Okay,	good.	I	think	that's
important	to	tell.	So	yeah.	And	then	this,	this	really,	all	it	does	is,	like,	why	I	do	what	I	do.	And
again,	I	don't	know	how	much	of	it	you'll	be	able	to	use,	sure,	but	some	of	it	means,	so
```
## michael	parsons

```
nice,	I	have	to	admit,	like,	no	one	ever	does	this.	Thank	you.
```
## Rachel	Smith 10:

```
Oh,	you're	welcome.	Well,	again,	like	I	said,	a	lot	of	it's	personal.	It's	not	anything	I	would	really,
typically,	I	wouldn't	share	this	with	anyone	else
```
## michael	parsons

```
in	there.	It'll	never	be	like	nothing	is	set	in	stone.	You	can	always	add	or	remove	as	you	Yeah,
it's	just	so
```
## Rachel	Smith 10:

```
but	it	just,	this	is	more	of	an	essence	thing.	I'll	give	you	an	idea	of	how	I	feel	about	people,	and
then,	you	know,	kind	of	what	I'm	looking	for	in	my	clients	and	psychographics	of	people,	and
how	I'm	connecting	with	my	ideal	folk.	And	then	my	program	designs	back	here,	anyway,	so,
and	then	this	view	method.	I	created	a	method	called	the	view	method.	It's	what	I'll	be	doing
with	my	coaching	clients.	I'm	still	kind	of	playing	with	with	with	view,	because	I	I've	been	using
AI	and	chat	to	the	team,	and	it's	coming	up	with	some	really	cool	things.	I'm	like,	Oh,	I	think	I
like	that	better.
```
## michael	parsons

```
And	that's	another	department	that	I	can	absolutely	like	when	it	comes	to	using	just	AI	in
general,	it	sounds	like	you	used	it	quite	a	lot.	How	long	have	you	been	using	chatgpt?
```
## Rachel	Smith 11:

```
Probably	for	a	couple	years.	But	not,	like,	not	like,	a	lot,	a	lot.	Just	like,	I'll	get	on	there	and	be
like,	okay,	whit	me	up	a	performance	review,	annual	performance	review,	so	I	can	fill	it	out	for
my	team.	It's	more	than	most	people.	So	is	it	for	a	lot	of	cheats	like	that?	I	wouldn't	even
```
## michael	parsons

R

R

R

R


## michael	parsons

```
call	it	cheating.	It's	just	the	new	tool.
```
```
Me,	I	feel	guilty.	I'm	like,	I	think	I'm	cheating.	No,
```
## michael	parsons

```
I	a	lot	of	people	do,	actually,	and	I	disagree.	No,	I	suppose	it	depends	on	your	use,	but	for	you,	I
think	none	of	that	is	cheating.	It's	always	smart	to	have	a	second	set	of
```
## Rachel	Smith 11:

```
sense,	which	is	great,	but	there	was	maybe	some	things	I	worked	on	the	side	to	come	up	with	a
phrase	or	two,	you	know.	But,	yeah,	I	think	for	that,	I've	used	it	for	book	outline,	like	her	book
outline,	I've	used	it	for,	like,	talks	like,	you	know,	speech	outlines	help	me	clean	up	some	of	my
language.	Do	you	have	a	book?	I'm	going	to
```
```
work	on
```
## Rachel	Smith 12:

```
writing	about	it.	So	that's	part	of	my	business.	But	I	want	to	be	able,	for	sure,	something,	yeah,
I	want	to	be	able	to	put	something	out	there.	Yeah,	you	know,	that's	probably
```
## michael	parsons

```
smart.	Well,	the	reason	why	I	asked	is	I	could	easily	just	link	it	to	your	website	and	say,	buy	my
PDF.	Even,	don't	even	have	to	necessarily	go	through	Amazon	and	get	a	book.	Yeah?	But	AI,
will	100%	be	a	use	for	you	in	the	creation	of	that	work?	Just	if	you	need	help	with	that	too,	just
let	me	know.
```
## Rachel	Smith 12:

```
Yeah,	okay,	I	will	let	you	know.	That's	yeah.	So	what	do	you	need?	So	what	do	you	need	from
```
## michael	parsons

```
me,	honestly,	if	you	just	give	me	a	second,	like,	look	this	up.	Yeah,	I've	done	more	than	I	can
ask	people	to	do	so	thank	you.	Like	Greg	was	spot	on	when	he	was	like,	You	should	have	some
```
R

R

R


```
ask	people	to	do	so	thank	you.	Like	Greg	was	spot	on	when	he	was	like,	You	should	have	some
questions	here.
```
```
Yeah,	it	was	very
```
## michael	parsons

```
helpful.	Is	there	anything	specific	that	you	know	that	you	want	in	a	website	like	any
```
## Rachel	Smith 13:

```
Well,	I	think,	I	mean,	obviously	I	need,	I	contact	information.	I	mean,	I	think	with	the	basic	stuff,
I	really	don't	know	much	about	website
```
## michael	parsons

```
design,	well,	I	guess	really,	what	I	mean	is,	there's	no	right	or	wrong	answer.	I'm	just	like
questions.	Is	there	a	color	palette	you	like,	or	are	there	images	that	you	would	want	included?
So	I	like
```
## Speaker	1 13:

```
because	it	is,	it's,	it's	kind	of	bordering
```
## Rachel	Smith 13:

```
this	intuitive	slash	leadership,	business,	professional	world.	I	don't	want	it	to	be	too	whimsical,
sure,	but	there	it	needs	to.	I	mean,	it	is	intuition,	it	is	intuitive	coaching.	And	that's	the	that's
the	unique	niche	that	I	have,	right?	That	sure	I'm	not	advertising	myself	as	life	coach.	So
there's	gotta	be	a	little	bit	of	that.	I	like	softer	colors	and	warmer	colors.	I	love	purple,	but	I	love
neutrals,	very	natural.	Yeah,	same	thing	kind	of
```
## michael	parsons

```
colors,	right?	Yeah,	yeah.	So,	okay,	and	there	are	no	specific	images,	just	anything.	I	was
playing
```
## Rachel	Smith 14:

```
with	chat	GPT	and	asking	it	to	create	some	logos,	and	I	tried	to	print	off	some	but	for	whatever
reason,	it	didn't	do	it.	And	you	can	always

text	me,	call	me	anytime.	I	A	lot	of	people	say	nine	to	five.	That's	not	my	style.	I'm	pretty	much
always	kind	of	doing	what	I	do,	and	I	try	to	get	back	as	quick	as	possible.	So	anytime	you	what
is	your	last	name,	Parsons.	Parsons,	D,	A,	R,	S	O,	N,	S.	You	think	someone's	familiar?

doing	here?	Well,	my	family	moved	here.	Well,	my	mom	and	dad	moved	here	when	I	was	a
teen,	so	I	guess	I	was	born	in	Kentucky,	and	then	we	moved	out	here	when
```
```
I	was	a	teen,	and	then
```
## michael	parsons

```
I've	been	living	in	DC	and	San	Diego	for	the	past	three	years.	But	I'm	back	now.	Yeah,	I	thought
I	could	leave.	Turns	out	I	can't.	Well,	which	family	is	the	best	reason	to	move?	Definitely,
```
## Rachel	Smith 15:

```
definitely	cool.	Well,	I'm	glad	because	you're	helping
```
## michael	parsons

```
me.	And	honestly,	like	day	three,	when	I	came	back,	I	was	just	hanging	out	the	man	house	and
doing	what	I	do	right?	When	Greg	comes	in,	I	was	like,	Hey,	Greg,	what's	up?	Guess	what	I've
been	doing	for	the	past	couple	years.	And	simple,	could	you	do	that	for	me?	Greg,	yeah,	cool.
So	let's	see	color	schemes	good,	no	particular	images	yet.	I	can	easily	that's	another	thing	I'm
pretty	good	at,	good	at	making	logo.	So
```
## Rachel	Smith 15:

```
I	was	gonna	ask,	I	was	gonna	be	a	question	I	had	for	you,	because	I	tried	to	go	on	and	just	took
up,	like,	free	logo	designs,	just	just	for	that.	Heck,	I	just,	they	were	ugly.	I	hear

you,	it	does	take	quite	a	while	to	bang	that

```
stuff	out.	It	was	they,	was	they.	It	was	just,	like	some	of	them,	like,	it'll	be	Rachel	Smith
coaching.	But	then	I'm	fine	with	some	just	all	words.	But	then	I	also	feel	like	there	should	be
some	images.
```
## michael	parsons

```
Let	me	ask	you,	when	was	the	last	time	you	tried	to	make	an	image	with	chat?
```
## Rachel	Smith 16:

```
Well,	that's	probably	why	I	can't	download	it	anymore.	It's	giving	me	an	error,	but	it	was
probably	a	couple	months	ago.	That's	why
```
## michael	parsons

```
they	have	basically	perfected	their	image	generation	now,	so	you	can	have	just	a	wall	of	text,
and	that's	perfect.	Well,
```
## Rachel	Smith 16:

```
you	know	what?	This	was	what	I	did.	Yesterday	was	not	on	chat,	but	yesterday	was	just	through
some	websites	online.	Oh,
```
## michael	parsons

```
for	the	logo	thing,	yeah.	So	not	only,	I	mean,	I	can	easily	make	you	a	logo,	but	I	could	have	you
ever	used	a	prompt	generator?	Have	you	heard	of	the	process?	Yes,	okay,	good.	So	that's
essentially	how	I	do	anything	that	I	can't	just	immediately	do	with	AI.	Let's	say	I'm	I	do
something	often,	and	it's	relatively	complex,	but	I	do	it	kind	of	all	the	time.	I	will	sit	down	and
work	on	specific	wording	for	exactly	what	I	want	and	the	task.	So	after	that,	I	essentially	have
all	that	information	saved.	All	I	have	to	do	is	say	we're	working	on	this	again,	do	this	kind	of
thing.	So	having	a	prompt	generator	for	image	creation	is	really	important.	There's	a	lot	of
variables	that	need	to	be	controlled	for.	And	so,	yeah,	anytime	I	can	help	you	with	that	stuff
too,	you	want	to	just	know	how	to	properly	interact	with	AI,	because

okay,	here	we	go.	So,	like,	I	have,	like,	intuitive	coaching	support,	and	I	have,	like,	all	of
everything	I	clarification	program.	Yeah.	So	everything's	like,	I	try	to	keep	it	on	the	same
thread.	I	think	my	logos	are	in	here.	That	is	smart.	So	when	I	kept	it	on	the	same	thread	to	work
through	this	so	it	knows	what	my	program	is,	then	I'm	able,	because	I	want	to	do	a	TEDx	talk	as
well.	I'm	doing	a	TEDx	talk	as	well	and	stuff.	So.	Remember.	So	I'm	going	to	talk	about	intuitive
leadership.	And	so	I	want	to	be	able	to	bring	all	this.	So	this	is	kind	of	a	hodge	project,	both
things,	but	that's	okay.	It	all	kind	of	says	the	same	thing.	I	was	trying	to	find	the	logos	right
now,	you're	welcome,	and	then	one	second,
```
```
you	we	did	start	to	load	something
```
## michael	parsons

```
Well,	it's	a	good	idea	to	keep	it	all	in	the	same	thread.	The	only	thing	is,	you'll	run	into
constraints.	So	one	of	the	constraints	for	large	language	models	is	context	window.	Have	you
ordered	a	context	window?	No.	So	a	context	window	is	you	can	think	of	it	as	how	much	a	large
language	model	can	think	of	that	it	has	not	already	known.	So	what	I	mean	by	that	is	there's	a
certain	amount	of	words	that	it	can	have	in	a	chat	and	understand	all	at	once,	and	as	soon	as
you	get	over	that,	it	starts	moving	like	this.	So	the	old	words	are	lost	and	the	new	words	are
gained.	Context	with	chat,	GPT,	the	open,	the	eye	models.	There's	somewhere	around	320,
tokens,	and	you	can	think	of	a	token	as	a	word,	okay,	but	this	is	one	of	the	reasons	why	I
suggested	Gemini.	Their	context	window	is	like,	five	times	larger,	so	it's
```
## Rachel	Smith 21:

```
either	a	million	or	2	million,	yeah.	And	this	one,	I	mean,	like,	this	threads	really	long,
```

and	you	can	send	that	to	me	too.	Oh,	I	can,

is	pretty	cool,	but	it	did	screw	up	the	letters.	It	would	definitely	do	that	correctly.	Now,	yeah,

going	to	send	it	to	you.	I	mean,	it's	a	lot	perfect.	The	more,	the	better.	It	might	not	be	100%

first.	Yeah,	yeah,	okay,
```
## Rachel	Smith 22:

yeah,	you	can	see	I	was	still	playing	with	you	here.	It's	giving	me	some	different	that's	where	I
was	like,

How	do	I	send	this	to	you?	Let	me	sit	so	I	actually	don't	use	the	bubble	very	often.

```
## Rachel	Smith 22:

```
different	things.	I	use	it	for	all	kinds	of	things.	Actually,	I'll	have,	like,	random	chats	with	it.	I'll
talk	with	it.
```
## michael	parsons

```
I	do	too.	Like,	legit.	I	had	my	aunt,	I	was	like,	anytime	that	you	need	help	with	something,	and
it's	maybe	you	don't	want	to	ask	someone,	because	you're	supposed	to	know	it,	right?	Ask
them,	you	won't	be	embarrassed.	Yeah,	I	do	that	all	the	time,	but	Lucia	had	figured	it	out.	So
anytime	there's	a	chat,	you	just	press	and	hold	on	it.	Oh,
```

okay,	got	it.	Second.

## Rachel	Smith 23:

```
Yeah,	so	on	the	website,	it's	basically,	you	know,	the	other	thing	I	don't	know,	I	was	going	to
ask	you	to	did	you	share?	Yes,	okay,	thank	you.	And	I	can	exit	out	of	this.	You	can	close	it	all.
You	can	close	it	all	was	like	a	payment	system,	like	my	domain	is	through	go	data.	I	think	that's
what	Greg	Greg	got	it	through	there,	and	so	he	sent	me	with	like,	oh,	365	and	all	of	that.	So	I'm
assuming	the	website	goes	through	that	too.	Is	that	right?	Essentially,
```
## michael	parsons

```
you	can	choose	it	anywhere	you	would	want	the	hosting,	and	then	the	domain.	Are	two
different	things.	Oh,	they	are,	okay,	see	this?	I	had	to	learn	this	too,	you	know?	I'm	saying,
Yeah,	I	can	do	the	hosting	for	free.	You	don't	have	to	necessarily	even	pay	for	that.	That's	a
new	thing	that's	kind	of	come	about	the	past	two	years,	is	that	you	can	kind	of	host	a	website
for	free,	the	domain	is	the	part	that	you	have	to	pay	for,
```
## Rachel	Smith 24:

```
and	it's	cheap,	annual.	Yeah,	I	think	he's	got	that	already,	right?
```
## michael	parsons

```
I'm	sure	if	he's	already	got	one	through	coaching.com	Yeah.	So	essentially,	the	way	it'll	work	is,
once	your	website's	created,	I'll	host	it	on	a	website,	and	then	that	domain	is	like	a	title	that
they	tag	onto	that	website,	so	that	people	know	to	go	to	that	specific	Yeah,	right.	I
```
## Rachel	Smith 24:

```
did	not	know	it	was	like	that.	Okay,	there	you	go.	Wow.	Okay.	And	then	how	do	you	So,	how	do
you	figure	out	which	payment	systems	to	use,	like,	if	somebody	wanted	to	purchase	coaching
package	online?
```
## michael	parsons

```
Probably	stripe.	Stripe	is	the	simplest	stripe.	Actually,
```
```
I	think	Eric	might	have	told	me	about	stripe,	and	that's	probably
```
## michael	parsons

```
why.	Because	I	think	it's	like,	if	I	had	to	guess,	they	are	at	least	80%	of	the	like,	personally
```
R

R

R


```
why.	Because	I	think	it's	like,	if	I	had	to	guess,	they	are	at	least	80%	of	the	like,	personally
posted	website,	sales,	payment	system,	Stripe,	okay?	And	they	did	it	on	purpose.	They	made	it
very	simple	for	people	to	use.	Makes	sense.	Put	it	on	your	website.	It's	easy,	okay,	so	that's
what	I	would	orient,	is	put	stripe	on	there	for	products	and	you	don't	have	any	yet,	right?	Okay,
so	on	the	website,	anything	that	we	don't	have	yet,	I'll	just	make	a	placeholder	for	so	it'll	just
kind	of	come	up	with	what	it	thinks	would	be	a	good	placeholder.	Okay,	right?	And	then
eventually	we	could	just	scoot	in	the	right	thing	and	delete	the	old	got	it,	trying	to	think,	what
else
```
```
I	had	a	question.	I	question,
```
```
contact	information.	What
```
## Rachel	Smith 25:

```
was	the	other	thing?	Eric	was	talking	something	about	Click	Funnels.
```
## michael	parsons

```
So	is	he	talking	about	lead	generation?	Maybe	that's	what	it	was.	Yeah,	lead	generation	is
that's	something	that	I	used	to	do,	and	that	was	like	15	years	ago.	I	will	say	that	skill	set	is
obsolete	for	me	because,	as	in,	I	don't
```
## Speaker	1 26:

```
we	just	remember	it,	yeah,	I	don't	know	if	I	need	all	that	you	need	for	sales.	It's	just	a	general,
yeah,
```
## Rachel	Smith 26:

```
but	just	like	a	way	to	collect	emails	off	the	website.	Oh,	that's
```
## michael	parsons

```
easy	too.	So	that	would	just	be	basically	a	form,	like	any	time	that	you	go	to	a	website	and
there's	a	section	where	you	put	your	name,	your	phone	number,	your	address,	it	really	just
takes	that	information	and	puts	it	into	a	little	like	text	file	so	that	you	can	manipulate	it	always.
```
R

S

R


```
So	for	me,	this	is	what	I	think	you're	asking.	I	would	have	a	section	at	the	bottom.	It's	like,
subscribe	to	my	newsletter,	get	on	your	name,	your	email	address,	and	then	it	will	make	a
master	list	of	all	the	inputs	that	are	put	in
```
## Rachel	Smith 26:

```
there.	Does	that	make	sense?	It	does	that	does	make	sense.	And	then	is	there	something	that,	I
guess,	this	might	be	different.	This	might	be	separate.	Then	the	an	email	platform	that	would
take	that	information	and	then	email	it	out	that	would
```
## michael	parsons

```
be	separate	and	different.	So	when	you	say	email	it,	so	like	the	newsletter	is	what	you're
talking	about,	yeah,	that	would	be	a	separate	entity,	but	the	requests	can	come	to	the	website.
So	the	way	I	just	don't	mind	I'm	viewing	it	right	now.	We	be	website,	automated	emailing
system.	Person	goes	to	the	website	says,	I	want	this	email.	Give	me	the	newsletter	every	week
they	give	you	your	name	and	your	email	address	that	gets	scooted	to	the	second	program	that
has	just	a	long	list	of	email	addresses	that	gets	sent	whatever	is	needed	for	the	week.	So
that's,	that's	what	I	would	do.	Yeah,	that	makes	sense.	I	haven't	brainstormed	it	at	all.	It's	just
kind	of	my	mind.	So
```
## Rachel	Smith 27:

```
I	just	wonder	which	email	platforms	to	use.	Eric	might	have	mentioned	some	too.	I	could	go
back	through	my	notes.	That
```
## michael	parsons

```
is	something	I	could	easily,	I	shouldn't	say	easily,	I	could	probably	easily	look	into,	because	that
is	an	aspect	that	would	be	separate.	Yeah,	it	doesn't	seem	like	it	would	be	any	more	difficult
than	actually	creating	the	website
```
## Rachel	Smith 28:

```
itself.	So	yeah,	we'll	see.	Yeah,	I	know.	I	mean,	we're	learning	probably	use	AI	for	it	too	well,
and	that's	what	that's	I	went	to	the	seminar	and	that	they	were	talking	about	that	using	AI	or
chatgpt	for	emails.
```
## michael	parsons

```
Yeah,	yeah.	So	that	is	actually	pop	Yeah,	that	we're	talking	about.	I	have	read	this	stuff	too,
yeah.	So	I	can	work	on	that	too.	How	about	that?	I
```
R

R

R


## Rachel	Smith 28:

```
think	that	sounds	great	an	idea.	Yeah.	Because	the	only	other	thing	I	think	he	said	was,	you
know,	we	would	need	to	have	the	ability	for	people	to	remove	their	names	from	the	email	list,
unsubscribe,	unsubscribe.
```
```
Yeah,	that,
```
## michael	parsons

```
that	part	I	also	don't	know	about,	but	I	don't	see	that	that	would	be	an	issue.	It	probably	have
to	do	with	whatever	automation	system	you	were	using	the	first	place,	yeah?	So	that	would	just
be	part	of	me	researching	which	automation	to	use,	like,	which	one	will	let	me	unsubscribe,
yeah,	and	be	nice	about	it,	right?	Yeah,
```
## Rachel	Smith 29:

have	anything	to	sell,	maybe

down	the	line,	sure,	I	just	like	making	stuff	using
